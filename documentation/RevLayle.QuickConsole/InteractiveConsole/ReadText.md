# InteractiveConsole.ReadText method

Reads text interactively from the console represented by the internal [`ISystemConsole`](../ISystemConsole.md) implementation. The result is kept in the console buffer and as a return value. Backspace key is recognized to delete characters input. The enter key read from the input signals the end of input and the string is returned.

```csharp
public string ReadText(int x, int y, int maxLength)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| x | X position in the terminal and console buffer to output text being read from the input |
| y | Y position in the terminal and console buffer to output text being read from the input |
| maxLength | Maximum length of string to read. Once the cursor of the console reaches this length or the width of the console buffer, no more keys are read for the string. |

## Return Value

The string read (and output to the buffer) until enter is pressed.
